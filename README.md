**Approach**

We built a contextual news recommendation system using user classification as context and news categories as arms.

**Algorithms Implemented**

* Epsilon-Greedy
* Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
* SoftMax

**Simulation**

Each algorithm was simulated for 10,000 steps using the provided sampler.

**Key Findings**

* UCB achieved the highest average reward.
* Epsilon required hyperparameter tuning.
* SoftMax performance depended on temperature.
